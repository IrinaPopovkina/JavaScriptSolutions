 
You need to format the elements of the array:

an item with an index of 0 - up to 0 marks after a comma;
element with index 1 - up to 1 mark after comma;
element with index 2 - up to 2 signs after the comma;
element with index 3 - up to 3 characters after the comma; And so on.
Write a feature named formatArray that accepts the arr array as an argument and returns an array in which each item is formatted according to this rule.

function formatArray(arr){
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    arr[i] = +arr[i].toFixed(i);
  }
  return arr;
}
