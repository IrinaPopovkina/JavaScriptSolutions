Write a function named power that takes the numbers a and n as arguments and returns the value of a to the nth power (a and n are non-negative integers). Use a for loop in your solution. You cannot use exponentiation and object methods in this assignment.
function power(a, n){
  let result = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
     result *= a;
    }
  return result;
}
