When you test a user registration page, you need to test the "Phone number" field. You have to do a lot of tests, and you decided to create random phone numbers - 11-digit numbers. The phone number should start with the symbol "z," the first number of the number should be 1.
write a feature called createPhoneNumber, which returns a random phone number in the form of a 12-length line starting with '1' and random numbers.

function createPhoneNumber(){
 let str = '+1';
  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    str += Math.trunc(Math.random() * 10);
  }
  return str;
}
