Two variables a, b are given.
If they are not equal, assign to variable a the value of the sum of these variables, to variable b - the value of the difference between these variables.
If the variables a, b are equal, assign each of them the value 0.
Print the new values of the variables a, b as an array [newA, newB].

Write a function named newValues that takes two numbers a, b as arguments and returns the new values ​​of the variables a, b as an array [newA, newB].

function newValues(a, b){
  return a !== b ? [(a + b), (a - b)] : [0, 0];
}
