The football team participated in several games of the football season.
The array stores information about the number of goals scored by each player in different games.
For example, the 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, ..., 2, 1, 1.
If a player has not scored a single goal, then there is no information about his goals in the array. That is, there is no element in the array. It is necessary to determine the total number of goals scored by the football team during the season.
Write the sumOfGoals feature, which takes an array of arr that stores data on the number of goals scored by each player in different games, and returns the total number of goals scored by the football team.
Use a loop in the solution. Array methods are not allowed.

function sumOfGoals(arr){
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for(let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
      sum += arr[i][j];
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
