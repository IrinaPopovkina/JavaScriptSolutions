Three numbers are given. Find how many positive numbers among them and how many negative numbers.

Write a function named countOfPosAndNeg that takes three numbers a, b, c as arguments and returns the number of positive and negative numbers in this set as an array [countOfPositive, countOfNegative].

function countOfPosAndNeg(a, b, c){
  let countPos = 0;
  let countNeg = 0;
  if (a > 0) countPos++;
  if (b > 0) countPos++;
  if (c > 0) countPos++;
  if (a < 0) countNeg++;
  if (b < 0) countNeg++;
  if (c < 0) countNeg++;
  return [countPos, countNeg];
}
