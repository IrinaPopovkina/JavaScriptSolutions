Three variables are given containing the names of people. Is there at least one name that starts with the letter "A"?
Write a function named nameStartsWithA that takes three strings str1, str2, str3 as arguments and returns:
"Yes" if at least one name starts with the letter "A",
"No" otherwise.

function nameStartsWithA(str1, str2, str3){
  if (str1[0] === 'A' || str2[0] === 'A' || str3[0] === 'A') return 'Yes';
  return 'No';
}
