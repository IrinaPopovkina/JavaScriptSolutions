Three different numbers are given. Get the sum of two big numbers.
Write a function called sumOfTwoLargest that takes three different numbers a, b, c as arguments and returns the sum of the two large numbers.

function sumOfTwoLargest(a, b, c){
  if (a > b && c > b) return a + c;
  if ( b > a && c > a) return b + c;
  if (a > c && b > c) return a + b;
}
