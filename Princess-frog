The frog princess eats 3 more mosquitoes daily than on the previous day. Determine on which day the number of mosquitoes eaten will exceed 1000 if n mosquitoes were eaten on the first day.
Write a function called frogPrincess that takes n (the number of mosquitoes on the first day) and returns the number of days that a frog will eat 1000 mosquitoes

function frogPrincess(n){
let sum = 0;
let days = 0;
 do {
   sum += n;
   n += 3;
   days++;
 } while (sum < 1000)
 return days;
}
