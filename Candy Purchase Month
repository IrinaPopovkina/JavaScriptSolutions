People buy most of the sweets in December for Christmas and New Years, and in February for Valentine's Day, and in October for Halloween.
Write a function called sweetSeason that takes the month number month (a number between 1 and 12) as an argument and returns:
"Time to buy sweets", if the month number is 2, 10, 12;
"Not the time to buy sweets", otherwise.

function sweetSeason(month){
  return (month === 2 || month === 10 || month === 12) ? 'Time to buy sweets' : 'Not the time to buy sweets';
}
