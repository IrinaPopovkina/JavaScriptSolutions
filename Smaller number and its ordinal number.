Two numbers are given. Find the smaller number and its ordinal number.
For example, given the numbers 7, 2. The smaller number is 2, its ordinal number is 2.
For numbers 8, 12, the smaller number is 8, its serial number is 1.
Write a function called smallerOfTwo that takes two numbers a, b as arguments and returns the smaller number and its ordinal as an array [number, index]. If the numbers are equal, return the first one.

function smallerOfTwo(a, b){
 return a > b ? [b, 2] : [a, 1];
}
