The word "TEENAGER" comes from the English. "teenager": "-teen" - suffix of numbers from 13 to 19 + "age" - age. Teenager is a teenager (boy or girl) between the ages of 13 and 19.

Write a function called isTeenager that takes age as an argument and returns the string "teenager" or "not a teenager". You must use a ternary operator in your solution.

function isTeenager(age){
  return age >= 13 && age <= 19 ? 'teenager' : 'not a teenager';
}
