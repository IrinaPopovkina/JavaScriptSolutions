When you pay the box office for the goods you bought, you received a check, which printed the prices and the name of the goods.
How much money do you have to pay for all purchases?

Write the purchaseValue feature, which accepts an array of values that contains the prices and name of each item purchased as an argument and returns the total purchase price.

function purchaseValue(values){
  let total = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    values[i] = parseFloat(values[i]);
    total += values[i];
  }
  return total;
}
