The angle is given in degrees (from 0 to 360). Find the angle in radians.

Write a function called angleInRadians that takes an angle value in degrees, angle as an argument, and returns the angle value in radians. Round the result to the nearest whole number.

function angleInRadians(angle){
  return Math.round(angle * Math.PI / 180);
}
